Text widgets provide advanced capabilities that allow you to edit a multiline text 
and format the way it has to be displayed, such as changing its color and font.
You can also use elegant structures like tabs and marks to locate specific sections of 
the text, and apply changes to those areas. 
Moreover, you can embed windows and images in the text because this widget was designed to 
handle both plain and formatted text.
After applying this method, the given tag is removed from the provided area without 
deleting the actual tag definition.
You can use this method to configure the tag properties, which include, 
justify(center, left, or right), tabs(this property has the same functionality of the Text widget tabs's property), 
and underline(used to underline the tagged text).
